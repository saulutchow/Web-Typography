        <h3 class="short-text">
            The Lobster font took a different approach.
            The new OpenType format gives us the
            possibility to have multiple versions of each 
            letter, and that's exactly what we are doing:
            Instead of compromising the design of our
            letters to force connections, we do what 
            lettering artist do. We draw many versions 
            of each letter and a lot of different letter-pairs 
            (aka "ligatures") so we always use the best
            possible variation of each letter depending 
            of the context of the letter inside each word.
            All this happens automatically in any browser 
            that supports ligatures.
